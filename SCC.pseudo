function SCC(G) do
    1.  call DFS(G) to compute finishing times f[u] for all u       //O(V+E)
    2.  GT = G.transpose()
    3.  call DFS(GT), but in the main loop, consider vertices in    //O(V+E)
        order of decreasing f[u] (as computed in first DFS)

    4.  output the vertices in each tree of the depth-first forest
        formed in second DFS as a separate SCC
